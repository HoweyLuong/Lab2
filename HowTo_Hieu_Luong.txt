How to run:
_Instal the Eclipse Workspace and add it to the system Path


In the file it will ask to enter the expression

_Use the infix math expression
The expression in here use the operator such as +,-,*,/,^
The expression can also contain sin cos tan cot ln log
and we can use the parenthesis and curly brackets to include that

For this program we need to run again many times to run again since I do not use while loop
